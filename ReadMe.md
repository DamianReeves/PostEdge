**PostEdge** is a library of [PostSharp](http://www.sharpcrafters.com) aspects. The project aims to be a source of useful aspects, as well as a foray into the PostSharp SDK.

The PostSharp SDK is unsupported by the PostSharp team and as such, finding help on how to use it can be difficult. This project aims to be a place where PostSharp SDK users can go to find out how to make their own PostSharp plugins.
